# Documentation

## Setup

`yarn install`

## Cross-environments

It supports cross-environments. Therefore, you have two (actually four) options to run tests:

### Running on local environment (http://localhost:3000)


`yarn test' 

or

`yarn open' 


### Running in docker environment (http://localhost:5000)


`yarn test:docker' 

or

`yarn open:docker' 




## P.S. I have changed an App just a bit. Therefore, some tests are failed in my version, but they are passed in real one.

## P.P.S Knowing that according to task description I should assume everything works properly 1 test still should fail. (as for me)
